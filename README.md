Hello, I am a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience and a PhD in International Relations.

I have experience working in international, multicultural, and interdisciplinary teams performing full-stack roles using tools such as Python (Django/Django Rest Framework) and Javascript/Typescript (Vue.js/Nest.js/Hono.js).

I have a strong foundation in data, both performing DBA functions (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) and engineering, building data extraction and ingestion pipelines, and creating web-focused dashboards (D3.js/Vue.js).

In addition to my work experience, I am very active in side projects. Notably, Flaremingo (https://flaremingo.com/), an application that allows the deployment of Cloudflare Workers (serverless functions) without needing to write code.

Tech Stack: Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, FastAPI, Javascript, Typescript, Vue.js, Hono.js, Nest.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cloudflare, AWS

I am open to collaborations. You can contact me via LinkedIn or email: pedro.diniz.rocha@gmail.com

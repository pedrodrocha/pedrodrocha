I am a software engineer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, with a background in Political Science. With a global and multicultural mindset, I have built data-driven software and told data stories for diverse audiences over the past 4 years. 

I have experience working as a full-stack engineer in projects using Node.js, D3.js, PHP, Laravel, Livewire/Alpine.js, MySQL, and Python. My previous experiences encompass a wide range of tasks, from scraping, cleaning, and structuring data from various sources to relational database modeling, REST API design and implementation, and the development of ETL pipelines and health check routines. Additionally, I have been building engaging data-driven user interfaces using Vue.js and the TALL (Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire) stack.

Drawing from my academic background in Political Science, I have honed my research and analytical skills, utilizing R and Python for data analysis and statistics. My educational journey, which includes a BA in International Relations, an MSc in International Security, and my ongoing pursuit of a Ph.D. in Peace and Conflict Studies, has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of complex issues. This empowers me to tackle unfamiliar problems, bridging the gap between product strategy and development.

In summary, I possess a diverse skill set that combines technical expertise with a passion for innovation, adaptability in high-ambiguity environments, and the ability to thrive on challenges. My experience in data-driven software development, coupled with a background in Political Science, equips me with a holistic approach to problem-solving. With my enthusiasm and energy, I aim to drive innovation, foster collaboration, and deliver exceptional results in every project I undertake.

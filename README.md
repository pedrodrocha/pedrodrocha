Hey , I'm Pedro, a Software Engineer skilled in Python (Django/Django Rest and Fast API) on the backend and Vue.js on the frontend. My background as a PhD Candidate International Relations brings a strong foundation in data, statistics, and analytics to the table, coupled with expertise in relational database design and administration.

With a focus on product vision and engineering and drawing from my experience as a Ph.D. candidate and researcher, I bring a rigorous analytical approach to product development. Collaborating closely with diverse teams, I translate user requirements into practical and impactful features. Using modern tools and methodologies, I deliver reliable products that meet and exceed expectations.

Teamwork is central to how I approach every project. With a strong belief in open communication and mutual respect, I flourish in collaborative environments where diverse viewpoints are valued. My journey, spanning academia and industry, has provided me with ample opportunities to lead small teams. Whether in research or professional settings, I've learned the vital role teamwork plays in achieving shared objectives.

I'm excited to explore potential collaborations. Drop me a message, and let's get started!

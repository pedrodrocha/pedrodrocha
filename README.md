I am a software engineer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, with a Political Science background and a global and multicultural mindset that has been building data-driven software and telling data stories for different audiences for the past 4 years.

As a data engineer who also is concerned about business value and product growth, I can help bridge product strategy and governance with the actual development and deployment of data products. 

I have experience as a full stack engineer in data projects using Node.js, D3.js, PHP, Laravel, Livewire/Alpine.js, and MySQL. They range from scraping, cleaning, and structuring data from different sources, relational database modeling and REST API design, and developing ETL pipelines and health check routines, to building engaging data-driven user interfaces.

I also have experience in political science research and data analysis/statistics using R and Python, mainly from my academic background. I have BA in International Relations, a MSc in International Security, and I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Peace and Conflict Studies

As a Senior Software Engineer and a PhD in humanities/political science, I bring a unique mix of technical expertise and analytics skills. 

In my current role I lead the end-to-end development of internal applications, using Node.js, Python, React, and Next.js to create cost-effective solutions that reduce dependency on third-party software. My work includes designing backend and frontend systems, optimizing databases for better performance, and integrating tools like Redis and Cloudflare KV to improve application speed.

Before that, as a Data Engineer and Research Lead at LANTRI, I built data pipelines and applied statistical models to uncover valuable insights. I also mentored MSc and BA students, teaching computational social science and programming.

Alongside my full-time roles, I’ve freelanced and helped build several projects, such as a geo-quiz platform and a data analytics and AI startup.

I enjoy mentoring junior developers and promoting a collaborative, learning-focused team environment. With a diverse technical skill set, including Python, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, React, Next.js, AWS, and more, I’m passionate about building solutions that contribute to both technical and business success.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about tech, product engineering, or any interesting projects!

Cheers!
